# icons

This repository provides community-provided icons for import into CalTopo.

- Icons must not be larger than 24x24. They will be scaled to 24x24 by CalTopo otherwise.
- Ideally, icons should be in SVG format, but can be PNG.
  - For those using GiMP to create icons, note that GiMP does not support creating SVG images.
- CalTopo provides some custom icon features available only through a Pro subscription
  - See documentation here: https://training.caltopo.com/all_users/accounts/account-items#icons
  - Custom icons can be stored in your CalTopo account and added to your map through the normal icon selector dialog window.
  - Pro subscribers also have the ability to colorize their icons.
- CalTopo (free edition) supports fixed-color custom icons via URL.
  - Icon URLs would be the GitHub URL with the query string `?raw=true`.
  - Enter the URL in the URL field in the icon selector dialog window.
- There are also some free icons available here:
  - https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com/category/markers/
  - https://github.com/free-icons/free-icons
- ChatGPT or Google Gemini may also be used to generate icons, but the quality of the generated icons vary.
